The cultural heritage explored in this publication is of even greater importance because these narratives, recorded as far back as 1970 by Milko Matičetov, are of excellent quality and can no longer be obtained in the field.</p><p>This extensive material, dealing with the varieties of language spoken in the area of Porabje, part of the Prekmurje region, had been recorded on magnetic tapes. They are archived at the Institute of Slovenian Ethnology of the Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Ljubljana, where they were stored unpublished for several decades. It was only after experts from both Porabje and Slovenia, well-versed in these dialects, joined forces, that such an extensive task was finally possible.</p><p>The texts included in the publication have been transcribed from tapes in a simplified dialectal transcript, with the character sets of the usual Slovene alphabet but with the preserved vocabulary and its specific prosodic features. All of the texts are also published in the standard Slovenian language. Two narratives are also transcribed in the phonetic dialectological transcription to serve as an example.</p><p>The introductory section includes studies addressing the development of the narrative culture of Slovenes in Porabje, their language and brief history, as well as a presentation of the storytellers who had narrated these folktales and legends to Milko Matičetov. The folktales have been included in the international database, in accordance with the existing scientific international typology, and are therefore available for further comparative research. The main features of the Porabje dialect are highlighted as well as existing differences between individual local particularities. This section concludes with a glossary of words used in Porabje, which contributes to the preservation and documentation of the language spoken in this area. This book is of particular importance to young people, who often no longer speak in the vernacular but are also not very familiar with the Slovenian literary language.</p><p>The book presents 238 narrative units, most of which are folktales and legends. Belief tales and mythological legends are by far the most numerous (75). There are also 6 animal tales, 23 tales of magic, 20 religious tales, 10 realistic tales, 10 tales of the stupid devil, 14 anecdotes and jokes, and 6 formula tales. Among the legends and in addition to the belief tales, one finds 17 humorous tales and only 8 historic tales. The rest include prophesies, customs, beliefs, riddles, and children’s word games (49). We find variations of many of the folktales and legends in international, and predominantly European, narrative traditions. However, the folktales and legends of Porabje exhibit a marked influence of both western (Slovenian and partly Austrian) and eastern (Hungarian) narrative traditions and creativity.</p></div></div></body></html>
