Slovene folklorist and collector of innumerable folk tales and legends, Milko Matičetov had amassed this treasure primarily in the period between the 1940s and the 1980s. Initially he conducted research in areas situated in the Western part of the Slovene territory which had been separated from the rest of Slovenia for over a quarter of a century. His goal was to preserve from oblivion the still-living Slovene folktales in Slovene Istria, the Karst, Goriško, Slavia Veneta and Resia, in Bovško, Vipavsko, and later also in Prekmurje, Porabje, Austrian Carinthia, and other main regions in Slovenia. Encountering a number of storytellers, he has managed to preserve several thousand of their tales on paper and on tape, even on film. Some of the storytellers possessed exceptional memory and were very good at recounting the many tales they had remembered. One of these was Valentina Pjelih, called Tina Vajtava (1900-1984), from Stolvizza (Solbica in Slovene) in Resia. Between August 1966 and August 1970, she recounted to Matičetov over four hundred stories.</p><p>The first to be presented in the Slovene Storytellers collection is Anton Dremelj – Resnik (1910-1960). A farmer from Petrušnja Vas in Lower Carniola, Resnik was one of the most gifted and marked storytellers in the area. Discovered by Milko Matičetov in 1950, Resnik was repeatedly visited by Matičetov between 1950 and 1959. These fifteen interviews resulted in 63 recordings of tales and of several short folk riddles and proverbs. The analysis of Resnik’s tales indicates following genres: six animal tales; eight tales of magic; two realistic tales; one formula tale; seventeen humorous tales and jokes; five belief tales; five religious tales; three historic tales; four anecdotes; two memorates; three tales on social issues; three tales retold after the večernice, a popular book series designed for the less sophisticated reader; four tales retold after literary themes. Some of them have been preserved in several variants, which provides an insight into Resnik’s transformation of lore. In addition to other available data, the fact that he inherited most of his tale repertory from his grandfather indicates that the tradition of master storytellers ran in the family.</p><p>This book is a systematic presentation of the process of recording Resnik’s stories both on paper and on recording tape. It also provides information on their place and time of publication; on the process of transcription and classification of Resnik’s entire repertory; on the way of life in Petrušnja Vas at the time of Resnik’s life; on Resnik’s life story; and on his memories of Resnik as a storyteller. The publication contains the entire repertory of Resnik’s tales which is outstanding not only because <span class="pagebreak" id="pb.323"> [323] </span>of its size but also because of its marked stylistic quality particularly noticeable in the animal tales and in the tales of magic. The text also includes a list of folktale types and notes. Folktales are written down exactly as the storyteller had related them in dialect. As in every other artistic creation, the story’s content and form remain an inseparable whole. A CD recording, which is enclosed, may be of use to other disciplines. In this manner, the material contained in this series will enable us to learn about the riches of the Slovene folk narrative that has been preserved well into the 20th, and possibly even into the 21 century.</p></div></div></body></html>
